### Built with

- Tailwind CSS

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

I gave myself the challenge to do the delete modal animated, and I acomplished that using framer-motion that I used a little bit back for a different project. It took a little doc-reading and I got it up and running fairly quickly!
